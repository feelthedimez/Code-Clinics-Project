# Code Clinics Group Project

Code Clinics is a booking CLI system that uses Google API. A student needs to book a specific time slot to attend a Coding Clinic session, and typically these sessions are one-on-one sessions with a more experienced person who can advise on the coding problem at hand. It only works with @wethinkcode.co.za email domain only.

### Bonus Functionality

There is an ics file - which is a Calendar Document. You can open it and see the bookings in an Application of your choice.

Path: 
```bash
~/code-clinic-booking-system/codeclinics/files/ics
```

### Things still to be Done

1. Adding more tests for certain modules.
2. Adding a functionality that will make the volunteer and patient 'status' to the event respond to 'Going' instead of 'Maybe'.
3. Making the terminal scroll horizontally rather than text wrapping information - and making the terminal output be clustered.


## Requirements
This system works on a Linux/iMac with bash terminal.

## Cloning the repo

Please add the git repo to your home directory. Run all the steps in order as they appear in this document:

```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/DamianOdendaal/code-clinic-booking-system.git
```

## Setup the System

Make sure you are in ```codeclinics``` directory, then run:

```bash
cd code-clinic-booking-system/codeclinics
chmod +x cal-setup
chmod +x wtc-cal
```

## Bash Configuration

Run the script below in your bash terminal:

```bash
code ~/.bashrc
```

Then inside that ```.bashrc``` file, add the script below at the end of the ```.bashrc``` file.

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/code-clinic-booking-system/codeclinics:$PATH"
```

## Installing Dependencies

Run the following command from any directory to download required packages:

```bash
cal-setup
```

## Running the System

Run the following to see what type of CLI commands work with our system.

### Code Clinic Commands

```bash
wtc-cal
````

## Working with your Personal Calendar

If you're not in @wethinkcode.co.za email organisation, the system will automatically kick you out. So, to move around that, go to:

```bash
cd ~/code-clinic-booking-system/codeclinics/login/user_auth.py
```
On the function ```def validate_email()``` on line 67, change the statement of the email ```@wethinkcode``` to your prefered email domain of your organisation - it can event be ```@gmail.com``` for testing purposes. 

### Volunteering for a slot

```bash
wtc-cal volunteer
````

### Viewing Slots

```bash
wtc-cal slots
````

### Booking a Slot

```bash
wtc-cal book <ui_code>
```

### Cancelling a Slot or Cancelling a Booking

```bash
wtc-cal cancel <ui_code>
```
